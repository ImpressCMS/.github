## Welcome to the ImpressCMS core repositories

- you are on your way to being part of a community-driven, multi-lingual content management system!

### Start with the core
- [ImpressCMS](https://github.com/ImpressCMS/impresscms)

### Add Modules
Modules extend the capabilities of your site so you can provide just what you need without the added weight of things you don't. You can also pick the best in class, depending on your needs.
- [ImpressModules](https://github.com/ImpressModules)
- [IPFModules](https://github.com/IPFModules)
- [IsengardBiz](https://github.com/IsengardBiz)
- [AmaryllisModules](https://github.com/AmaryllisModules)
- [iForumModule](https://github.com/iForumModule)
- [VariousImpressCMSModulesBox](https://github.com/VariousImpressCMSModulesBox)

### Legacy Modules
These might need some work to be functional in a current instance of ImpressCMS. ICMS v 1.3 introduced a tool to help find deprecated functions and point you in the right direction to update them. It's included in the core and you just need to enable debugging for the site to find those deprecated functions. You'll probably want to start testing these modules in an instance running ImpressCMS 1.3.11 to begin the update process.
